===

This is the source code of my blog, [Smelly Tofu](http://blog.phil.tw/), statically generated by [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

Usage:

- `stack build [--install-ghc]` on this folder, and wait half an hour.
- The generated binary `site` will be found in a directory like `.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-ncurses6/lts-5.18/7.10.3/bin/`, run `site build` in the current directory.
- Deploy.
